    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around
        delicious
        pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the
        boxed
        stuff).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour: </strong>This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder: </strong>Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar: </strong>Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt: </strong>A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste
            salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong> and <strong>butter: </strong>Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the
            pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg: </strong>A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.
        </li>
    </ul>
