    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I'm showing you how to make what I like to call Sloppy Chickens, which are a cross between a pulled pork sandwich
        and a
        classic ground beef Sloppy Joe, except this chicken version is way easier than both of those. And don't let the
        name
        fool you, we're not going to need to pull any chicken, since as you'll see, it actually pulls itself. Garnish
        these with
        more green onion if desired.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ large yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>¾ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>½ cup diced jalapeño pepper</li>
        <li>4 medium hamburger buns - split, toasted and buttered</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step</h2>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Add vegetable oil to a saucepan, and then add (in this order) garlic, yellow onion, brown sugar, kosher
            salt, black
            pepper, cayenne, chicken thighs, ketchup, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Place over high heat and wait until you can hear the garlic sizzling in the bottom of the pan, about 30
            seconds. Let
            garlic sizzle for about 30 seconds before adding the water. Stir everything together and wait for the
            mixture to boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken falls apart, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Stir in the green onions and peppers and cook until the peppers just turn tender, 3 to 5 minutes more. Taste
            for
            seasoning.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and serve on toasted hamburger buns.</li>
    </ol>
